![pico-tak cartrige](https://github.com/The1Rogue/pico-tak/blob/main/pico-tak.p8.png)


you can find the rules for the game on the [ustak](https://ustak.org/play-beautiful-game-tak/) website

pico-tak currently only supports 6x6 size, with standard piece counts and no komi.

a *very bad* bot is also implemented, perhaps ill try improve it in the future.

a web version can also be accessed [here](https://the1rogue.github.io/pico-tak/)
